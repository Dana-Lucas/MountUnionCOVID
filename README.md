# MountUnionCOVID
A program that navigates to the Mount Union COVID page, extracts the latest COVID data, appends the data to a txt file, and creates graphs of all the data showing active, recovered, and total cases on campus.

Upon running MountUnion_COVIDAnalysisProgram.py, a GUI window will appear and the user will be able to "check for new data" and update the COVIDCases.txt file, as well as display various plots showing COVID over all of time and individual semesters, or comparing semester data on top of each other.
