# MountUnionCOVID
A program that navigates to the Mount Union COVID page, extracts the  latest COVID data, appends the data to a txt file, and creates a graph  of all the data showing active, recovered, and total cases on campus.

Upon running COVIDCases.py, the current data will be shown in the console and a plot will be created using the data in the text file COVIDCases.txt
Current data will automatically be added to the txt file before creating the graph
